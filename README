Implementation & Overview:

This Chatbot is implemented with React.js (Frontend) and Node.js (Backend). The chatbot utilises
keyword spotting to stimulate an intelligent conversation. The keywords are stored in a JSON file
in a case-based hierarchy to track the different conversation stages. It is possible to add more 
Keywords by just updating the responses.json file.

Topic:
Our Chatbot is a car dealership chatbot, designed to answer general questions about the cars that
the dealership sells and service offerings. It's also possible to make an appointment for a variety
of things such as a test drive or maintenance services.


To locally start the site:
1. Run npm install in both the server and client directory to install all required dependencies (only necessary for the first time)
2. Run npm run build in the client directory to create the build folder to be served to the server  
3. Run npm start in the server folder to start the server - a link to the localhost will be logged in the console
4. To locally access the chatbot, you can follow the link in the console or run npm start in the client directory (after starting the server) to automatically open the webpage

Secret Key:
In order to authenticate the sockets, upload your own secret_key.txt file in the server directory that stores the secret key or change the current secret key.
